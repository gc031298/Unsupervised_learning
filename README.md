## Project - Manifold Sculpting

Manifold sculpting is a manifold learning technique which iteratively reduces dimensionality by simulating surface
tension in local neighborhoods. We qualitatively compare this method with other dimensionality reduction methods, such as isomap, t-Student stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP), locally-linear embedding (LLE)
